# Simple Client-Server
This is a simple client server app written in C++ and was completed as an assignment for an Operating Systems course. The client can send the server a message, and the server will respond by sending the message back in all uppercase. 

# Setting up the Project
1. Clone or download [this repository](https://github.com/andrew-hart/Simple-Client-Server)
2. From the commmand line enter the command `make all` in the directory where you cloned or downloaded the project
3. Start the server from the command line using `./Server`
4. Start a client from the command line using `./Client`. Each client needs to be in its own terminal.

# Termination
To shut the program down, simply enter `done` in the client window (Note: this needs to be done for each individual client). It is case sensitive.
